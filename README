# csvorbis

This is Vorbis# version 1.1.0

Vorbis# is a C# OggVorbis decoder written purely in C#.  It is based off of
the Java version (Jorbis v0.0.12).

### Building

The code can compile with Microsoft's .NET SDK 7.0 / 8.0 cross platform using
`dotnet build`.

The compile will produce three files:
```
csogg.dll
csvorbis.dll
OggDecoder.dll
```

This code has been tested extensively with the mono JIT.  The MS will work as
well, but you're on your own to use it to play sound in realtime (i.e., write 
your own audio backend).  Pnet is untested completely.  Don't even try this
with Rotor, unless you have a lot of time on your hands.
